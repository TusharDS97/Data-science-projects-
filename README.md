##üåû Solar PV Fault Detection using VGG16 (CNN-based Model)
##üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting faults in grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) systems using deep learning techniques. The model is built on VGG16, a popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, to classify and identify various types of faults in solar panels.

The goal is to provide a reliable and automated way of monitoring solar PV systems to improve performance, reduce downtime, and support preventive maintenance.

##üöÄ Features

CNN-based classification using VGG16

High accuracy in solar PV fault detection

Preprocessing of input images for model training

Transfer learning for optimized performance

Scalable for real-world solar monitoring systems

##üìÇ Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of solar PV panels with different fault conditions and normal states.

Normal condition

Faulty panels (e.g., cracks, hotspots, dirt)
